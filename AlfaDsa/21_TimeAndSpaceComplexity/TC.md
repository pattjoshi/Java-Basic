# Time and Space complexity

## Time complexity 
- **Time complexity is the time taken by the algorithm to execute each set of instructions.**

## Space complexity

- **Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.**

- If I use HashMap or ArrayList or other data structure, dose this mean I have made a new space,so the space complexity is linear?

- Time and space complexity depends on lots of things like hardware, operating system, processors, etc.
