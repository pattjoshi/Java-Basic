# DATA TYPES -VARIABLES AND LITERALS

### [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/charts/)

- Hexa decomal = 0x

## Data Types:

- Data is an important part of a program which is said as the ingredient of a program
- Variables are meant to store data.
- Data is stored only after the variable is declared.
- Data can be both signed and unsigned.
- Negatve numbers are stored in the form of 2’s complement

#### There are Basic built-in datatypes in the compiler of java. There are **four** categories of **primitve datatypes**:

             • Integral – they can have any numerical value without decimal point.
             • Float – Have numerical value with decimal point.
             • Char – for storing characters.
            • Boolean – for storing true or false.

## Integral data type is divided depending on the size

        - o byte
        - o short
        - o int
        - o long.

## Floatng point is divided depending on the precision size –

            • float -- decimal point is known as float as the decimal point is floated away.

                    Example: 163.25 is wriRen in the form of mantssa and exponent as
                    16325*10^2 i.e 16325E-2.
                    IEEE standard number 754.
            • double – for more precise value a8er decimal.

## Char values have 2 bytes (\*Java uses Unicode).

        • ASCII codes are subset of UNICODE

        For A-Z = 65-90
        a-z = 97-122
        0-9 = 48-57

# Boolean – True is represented using ‘true’.

         False is represented using ‘false’

# 1 ss 2.16

### To know size of a data type is

```
        System.out.println("Max value:- " + Integer.MAX_VALUE); // 2147483647
        System.out.println("Min value:- " + Integer.MIN_VALUE); // 2147483648
        System.out.println("Byte value Intiger:- " + Integer.BYTES); // 4
```

# Variables

➢ Variables are names given to store data in memory allocaton.
➢ Variables are to be declared and initalised.

# 3ss 3.24

### Rules to name variables:

• variable names differ in upper and lower cases.
• contains alphabets, numbers and _, $.
• variables may start with an alphabet or _, $.
• it should not contain built-in words like int, float, if, while etc.
• it should not contain the built-in class names.
• name can be as long as possible.
• follow camel cases example- Roll Number, Average Marks.

# Literals

# ss 013 :- 3.12

# ss 013 :- 6.30

# ss 013 :- 11.6

# ss 014:- 11.05

# ss 016:- 4.12

# ss 016:- 7.22

➢ constant values(numbers) used in a program.
➢ there are different types of literals:
• int literals- representng integer type.
• float and double literals- representng decimal type.
• char literals-representng characters in single quotes.
• string literals-representng characters in double quotes.
➢ Literals are wriRen based upon the data types:
➔ int literal – int, short and byte.
• int literals can be represented in different number systems:
Decimal.
Binary.
Octal.
Hexadecimal.
• L or l – long.
• F or f – float.
• D or d – double.
• ’’ – char.
• true/false – Boolean
